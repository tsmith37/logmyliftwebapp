- Start page
    - need to think through what this would even be
- Exercise list page
    - show statistics on the page
    - make this look good
    x allow edit via modal
    x button to add new
    x don't show the full list by default (pagination?)
- Exercise page
    - show PRs/max effort
    x don't allow delete/update from this page? not the main function of the page, at least
    x show all lifts for the exercise
    x allow sort
- Workout list page
    - make this look good
    o show some basic info on the page
        - could still use some work, set count, duration, etc
    x sort mechanism
    x button to add new
    x don't show the full list by default
- Workout lifts page
    - we shouldn't be able to go to an old workout and start making changes
    - Add Lift
        - add lift should have some spacing and not look so bad
        - exercise selection should not push down the rest of the dialog
        - move description to its own line
        x add lift should remember your last lift
        x be nice to pop a dialog instead of a new page
    - Some way to collapse exercises so the page doesn't scroll down infinitely
        - kind of addressed this with pagination, but considering collapsing by exercise isnt a bad idea
    x from a lift should be able to go to exercise
    x Should be able to delete a lift
    x Should be able to copy a lift
    x fix the datetime formatting
    x Edit Lift
        x edit lift should allow...editing
        x edit lift should always show the comment field
- Nav bar
    - Fix spacing/visibility issues with certain buttons
    - start new workout should immediately jump to it
    x continue most recent
- Maxes
    - figure out when to populate this table
    - determine if the columns in this table are really needed
    - some way to build out different training schemes would be cool
        - i.e., you can go in and program max % and reps for nsuns, 
            then when you go to your workout it should suggest the next set based on training max, %, and rep range
